## Story

- I am able to shout out for Bruce's horse and wagon Imporium
- Notice a carpet with maybe following us, with possibly two guards looking for something, not sure what
- LS attempts to shout out to all around that we are advertisors for hire
- Toni wakes up from being knocked out, by a bump in the road
- LS and I attempt to keep the guards from noticing us and succeed with a little help from Kag and Toni
- Continue making our way to the edge of town, as the guards move in a bit closer, lower and right behind us
- We continue to shout as a man with a mule asks for advertisement
  - LS asks Kag to stop to help this man
  - Toni threatens to "Burn them all" with his turrent if we stop, using his hot butter knife tool
  - Kag attempts to stop him, but he makes Toni toss his hot knife upon a horse's ass
  - The wagons starts to veer off as the one horse speeds up, slowing veering off to the right
- Kag slows the wagon back down, speaking with the horses
- LS is able to charm the "driver" guard, saying "If I had once of those shells, my job would be easier"
- The second guard questions if LS is an escapee, and lands on the ground
- Jose, the man with the mule, approaches LS and asks if he can advertise for him
  - LS gives a great pitch to Jose, and asks for wares to showcase during advertisement
- Toni shouts to Kag to go get LS, the "Face"/"Salemen" of our group
- Salsa - the charmed guard, driver, tries to hand LS "The Announcer", the magical shell to LS
- Unego Montana - a Royal guard, the uncharmed guard attempts to stop the handover
- Kag stops the horses, runs and picks up Toni's butter knife and rushes back to the wagon
- LS attempts to suggest the uncharmed guard, Unego, to simply leave and go back to work
  - He shrugs it off and asks more questions
- Jose asks about the price of advertisement and is about to show his wares he wishes to sell
- I use Minor Illusion to create a British announcer voice, "Here we find Anthoine, in a lowly state"
  - "How did I come to this?! My quest for power how left me alone. They have all left me..."
  - It unfortunately doesn't distract the guards by LS
- Toni is scared of what Kag might do, and begs to renegotiate the terms of our business partnership
- Unego grabs LS and questions who LS "friends" are
  - LS motions to me, as a friend
  - Unego shouts for Herro to come over and answer questions
- Kag rushes right up to Unego and stabs him with a "spear" from the bag of holding, piecing his armor
- LS attempts to free himself and grab "The Announcer", but fails to get free
- Jose rushes away, "Advertisement isn't worth my life!"
- I attempt to mock Unego, but I fail, and move closer
- Toni attempts to control the horses, but is knocked into the back of the wagon and the horses take off
- The guards attack Kag, as I shout at Unego to distract him, but they both strike Kag, dealing large damage
- Kag slices Ungeo, cutting him up well
- LS attempts to mock Unego, but fails too; heals Kag
- Herro is able to successfully mock Unego, and also heals Kag
- Toni attempts to make the horses go faster, but causes the axel to break and the horses to go crazy
- The guards attack Kag, dealing more damage to him
- Kag slashes Unego, trying to cut him down and take his mace
- LS sneakily snatches "The Announcer"; heals Kag; walks past Herro toward the wargon "I'll take care of the wagon, your turn with the guards"
- I again mock Unego, and heal Kag; responding to LS "Sounds like I have the easy job, good luck with Toni"
- Toni attempts to slow the horses, but it doesn't affect anything; so he readies a grease spell for next turn
- The guards attack Kag, but Unego misses, probably distracted by being mocked
- Kag smashes Unego and attempts to intimidate Unego by snarling at him
- LS dashes closer to the cart
- I mock Unego yet again, and heal Kag best I can "I'll do my best, but I can't keep this up forever"
- Toni casts grease under the horses, as they fall, but fall safely; he then mends the axel
- The guards both attack Kag, but both miss
- The horses manage to get up
- Kag slices up Unego further yet, who looks very rough at this point
- LS continues rushing to the wagon and takes in the scene
- I fail to mock Unego this time
- Toni tells LS "The horses tried to get away, but I stopped them. I seem to have solved things here." as he high fives LS and tries to take something from him
  - Toni tries to take the magical bell off of LS, who does notice it is taken after hearing it "go off", but not sure what happened to it
  - Toni drops the bell upon seeing this, and LS notices the bell on the ground, not knowing what happened
- The guards attack, but miss; Unego rushes away and returns to the carpet to try to leave
- Kag rushes up to him, cuts him in half, down the spine, and captures his mace from his hand
- LS questions what happened to the horses, which appear to have a little damage
  - LS heals the horse that was burnt previously
  - then waits for Herro and Kag to catch up
- Herro moves around to be next to Kag and mocks Salsa successfully
- Toni asks why they aren't going anywhere, hearing from LS "We're waiting for the boys."
- Salsa moves up on Herro and swings at him, but misses
- Kag smashes the mace into Salsa, brutally busting his kneecap
- LS charms Toni and opens a discussion with him to keep him distracted, as Toni tells him his hopes and some secrets
- Herro tries to mock Salsa, but fails
- Toni continues talking about his plans and LS slowly moves Toni into the back of the wagon, and gets "buckled" (tied) in
- Salsa stikes Herro with his weapon
- Kag completely destroys Salsa face, turing it into jelly along with the rest of his head
  - Kag finds some gold and tinder kit and sword upon Salsa
  - Finds a pendant on Unego and grabs the hovering carpet
- We all group back up in the wagon and continue on
