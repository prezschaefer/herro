## Story

- Kag and Herro return back to the Blue Boar Inn after the trouble while getting a hat for Kag
  - Kag wasn't able to chase down the theif, little upset Herro disappeared on him
- Herro mentions he saw the theif's (or believed their's father) and things went very poorly
- Herro gives LS the lavender hat he bought, but LS just grumbles
- The old elf, and man with him, in the Inn leaves in the afternoon
- Kingsly is talking up The Lady, and her beautiful voice
- Kag takes a large bucket of water to his room for "personal" reasons
  - Kag returns for the room key from Herro, then heads back up
- Herro is writing a sonet about poor Marci Flowertop's life and "death"
- Kag gets his hat delivered, doesn't tip the delivery boy, who just leaves cause it's not worth it
- Old elf and man return later that night
  - Quiggly (old man) and Oris (old elf)
- Herro recites the sonet he wrote about what happened to Marci
  - Sammule lets him know he can perform any time he wishes
- The party gets a good rest on this 6th night
  - Herro again has the room key
- LEVEL UP to 5
- Herro awakes with inspiritation to write a new song, goes downstairs since Kag is snoring
- Herro joins LS for a breakfast ale
- Kingsly and Kag join shortly after each other
- LS bluntly asks Sammule where The Lady is
- Scared Sammule is going to report this, LS casts Suggestion and tells Sammule to go get a new chair in Paocinon
- Sammule leaves as LS tells Missy, the cook, to make breakfast for the party (acting as Anthony VanWinkle)
- LS attempts to get everyone to leave, "Sammule had a family emergency", but it fails horribly
- Herro disguised as Sammule gets everyone to leave, as he (Sammule) has business with the city magistrate
- Party eats breakfast and such alone, Missy is sent home and Kag barricades the door
- Herro shoo's most away from the Inn
  - Tells one "We have a rat infestation"
  - Keeps in mind to blame this rumor on rival inn, Rock's Roost Inn
- Guards arrive later, with Mrs. Treehertz, wanting to inspect things
  - Herro, as Sammule is able to get them to leave without issue, for personal reasons
  - Guard and woman (staying at the inn) won't come back until 3-4 pm
  - Herro gives the woman 5 gp (refunding for her room)
- Everyone finds out the woman's room and Herro uses Knock to open the door
  - LS finds a magic pan in the room and gives it to Kag
- While waiting for The Lady meeting still, hear a procession/shouting
  - "Celebration for our Lady, Chantia, upcoming"
  - 8 acolytes with one priest
- A male gnome knocks wanting to talk about the Lady Chantia, beautiful goddess
  - After vetting him, best we can without knowing, we invite him in to talk
- He, acolyte Sherman, then spills the beans
  - During the festival, there is a chamber below the main square, in front of Temple of Chantia
  - A spell is being casted during the festival, of multiple people into a vase of water
    - Water is sprinkled over all the crops to make them healthy
  - We are to steal the water after it has been enchanted and before it is used/delivered
  - Sherman will be in the ceremony, so may assist or be able to get us in to get the water
