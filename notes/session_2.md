## Story

- I grab whatever food I can, dropping the 'sword' I've had in favor of the food
- we have just landed outside the kitchen second story winow
    - a number of people have noticed us and how filthy we all look
- Kag shouts for someone to call the guards as the castle is being attacked
- The carpet above is lavender with stag horns, as it travels away
- We rush west from the castle, following Toni's lead, as he is carried by Kag
    - I yell for everyone to find cover, disguised as a guard, kind of causing a panic
- We attempt to act normal as we arrive at this area Toni pointed us to, Arcane Craft
    - Tantinni's Tinker Shop
- Kag and Toni walk over to the Tinker shop and pick up a number of bags of holding
    - Kag and Toni play with them, almost opening a rift between dimensions
- LS attempts to steal a bathrobe off of Tantinni's table, getting seen, tosses me one as well
    - LS attempts to rap to make some coin, as I try to join
    - Toni has Kag pick up a couple bags and threatens to merge them if we don't get free stuff
- The shop keeper, Larry, casts slow as things start to go out of control
    - I attempt to charm two people from crowd, get one to pay for LS's 
        - Sal pays 20 gp for one of the robes, as we try to return the other
        - I provide my name as Ahohako, a guard attempting to perform
- LS convinces one person in crowd to "Go Crazzzyyy!!"
    - This person works at the FBI (Flitprest Burger Instantution), fast food
- Toni threatens him again, asking Kag to toss him if they don't get what they want
- Kag tosses Toni at Larry
    - Toni is able to adjust and plant the two bags of holding, now merged, onto Larry
    - A large blast of air is ejected from the merged bags
        - Toni takes a large amount of damage, while Larry somehow doesn't
- Kag collects a number of different things, candles, bells, spinners, and a bag of holding
    - Toni is flung back, passed out, to Kag, who catches him, setting him on the ground
- Larry heals himself and calls for help against theives
- I heal Toni, pretty well, but that's all I can do (slowed)
- LS attempts to mock Larry, but he shrugs it off, and LS loses his one fan in the crowd
- The crowd attacks Kag, slightly hitting him
- Toni tells us his address and attempts to run, but is hit while he passes through the crowd
    - The crowd is starting to turn on us
- Kag, surrounded, rages and rushes to follow Toni and run off
- I jump on the table and shout for everyone to return home, as a guard, an attack on the castle is causing panic and looting
    - Motion to LS to get the hell out
    - Two Blundemons guards in dark blue-grey armor take interest in me
        - Ornate weapons on them, seem more dangerous
        - Gold inlaid sheath and weapons
- LS follows Kag and Toni, attempting to leave the area
- Toni guides Kag to the exit and entices Kag to move further than he normally can
- Kag rushes back, picks up LS and then rushes back to exit the square
- Larry exits the shop with two others, explaining the situation
- I hop down and attempt to Slip Into Shadow within the crowd, dropping my guard disguise
    - Unfortunately, I drop it too soon and no one seems to be fooled (natual 1)
- LS inspires Kag, as he is being carried
- We make it out safely, in all the panic
- LS sneaks some clothes for us near the Marketplace, as we make our way to Toni's
    - Pink pants for Toni, no Poncho's available for Kag, but a big shirt for him instead, and simple shirt for myself
- LS and Toni pass themselves off as family (Toni a little girl in pink pants)
    - Get us through the last gate in town
- We get close to Toni's, we go off to find hot food, then meet Toni at his place; knocking 3 times when we arrive
- I buy some hot dumpling soup and a keg of the town's ale to have a "broke out of jail" feast at Toni's, costing 8 gp
- Kag almost steals a dog, talking with it about having fun, but it determines it likes the food it is given, even though it is bored
- I notice two people in an alleyway, whispers to each other, one is watching us
    - have daggers, in their 20's, no armor
    - try to hide they were watching us
    - one runs off
- LS attempts to charm the one remaining, but they simply rush off
