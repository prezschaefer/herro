- Kag gets the horses to speed up and the party makes it's way out
  - Herro uses Minor Illusion again to shout, "You'll never get it you incompetent fucks! Danny's horses as shit!!"
- The wagon races through the streets, as everyone hangs on, as we see two new guards walks along
  - Kag appologizes for the speed and says the market commotion caused it
  - LS shouts, "Danny fucks his horses!" as we convince the guards to rush to the market
