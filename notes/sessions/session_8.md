## Story

- Leave the two gnome bodies in the alley, faces bashed in by a mace (Kag's)
- News on the attempt on the King's life is starting to spread in Merish
  - One escapee from jail was labeled as a savage blood drinking Orc
- A man approaches after hearing "Bruce's Wagon Imporium"
  - Needs a horse, but one to get to Bruce's too, mentions Danny's
  - I tell him of a horse massacre responsible by Danny
  - Horse graves are NW of Merish, poorly marked within some trees
  - Tell the man the mess in the market was started by one of Danny's man
- Continue on closer to Blue Boar Inn, ask a few folks where we can keep our horses/wagon
  - Run into Trevor, clay pit worker, who provides us information on a place we can keep them
- Keg and Herro look into securing a room at the Inn for the three of us
- Very light atmosphere, in a packed set of tables and bar
  - Grab a table and order a drink and inquire about lodging
  - Motions toward Sammule about lodging, behind the bar
- While waiting for drinks and Kag's slab of meat, listen around
  - Hear gossip on King's attack attempt, blaming Jabrim leadership
- Kag loudly mentions a gnome was responsible for attacking the King
  - Daniel brings us our drinks and we try to decieve her
  - She doesn't believe our story the gnome was as ferocious as an orc
- LS enters after about 20 mins, wondering what our progress is like
- Kag rushes out and intimidates someone looking at the wagon, Looky Lue
- LS and Herro look into aquiring some room(s)
  - As I wait for a drink and to talk with Sammule about lodging, I begin to hum/sing
  - It is so great, Sammule approaches immediately and offers me free lodging to perform
  - I turn it down this time, but perhaps next time
  - Give Sammule 8 gp for two rooms for the day
- LS goes up to rest, I bring a ale out to Kag
- Trevor returns saying the Smithensons' will take our horses and wagon in
  - He guides us there at a normal 20 min slow pace
  - Arry and Larry, personal guards at the estate, let us in
  - Rose bushes around the wall surrounding the walls
  - One guard at the front building entrance, two story primary building
  - Few apple trees around, stalls at rear of the building
