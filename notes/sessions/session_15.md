  - another small pouch with 3 vials of different powders
  - 3 rubies
- The Great Danton, with a cheap dagger from Kingsly, wipes blood on it and dries it with Presidigitation
- The Great Danton puts on a great scene as he puts together the pieces of this criminal puzzle
  - The elves were seen leaving the temple when the priest died
  - They chased this group through the streets
  - Arrived at night to kill these people
  - This dagger with blood might tie it all together
- The wound I had gotten moving to save LS, taken from the female elf, is causing my dragonmark to sear
- The Great Danton is able to close the matter with the guard, Frank, who leaves, as does the Great Danton
- Kag strips the bodies of weapons, armor, and cloaks
- While the rest rest for the night, Herro checks the blades
  - One is almost electric, that Herro can't pick it up

- In the morning the party study the items they collected from the elves last nite, studying them
  - LS and Kingsly study the swords
  - Herro asks to look at the 3 leaves
  - Kingsly names the gold one "The Angel"
  - Herro names the red one "The Demon Spirit"
  - Kingsly notices they have magic and some kind of magic is subduing the leaves nature magic
- Kag tastes one of the powders, large grained white powder, as it pours smoke out
  - The second finer grained white powder, does nothing
  - The yellow powder makes Kag's touch go numb, not spicy
- LS and Herro go down for breakfast
- Kag and Kingsly join later, as we notice Frank talking with a town guard, Cassian
- Kingsly goes up to talk with the two guards, introducing himself
  - The town guard winks as they try to grab Kingsly
- Kag notices this, and LS tells him to throw the course white powder vial
  - It shatters on the ground, just spilling across the floor
  - Herro tries to throw his mug toward the powder on the floor, but hits a random person knocking them out
- Kingsly dodges one of the guards, claims his innocence and runs out the Inn, expeditiously
- Cassian chases after Kingsly calling out he is under arrest
- Herro uses mage hand to spill a mug near the white powder on the floor
  - 500 feet of smoke is expanded and visibility is down to 5 feet
- Someone runs into Kag, who simply kills him (although no one can see or knows)
- LS tells Kag to get the rope we got out and tie together to leave
- He rushes toward the door, but falls down, then tries again, out the door into the traffic filled street
- We get out, but Kag returns to get the horses, which we then head to the temple to find Kingsly
- Use Sherman to send out a message, as the priests call out around town
  - Tell him to announce that the Great Danton has been seen at the temple and plans to join the festival
  - Word reaches Kingsly, now Kid Charlemagne, at the Blue Boar Inn, who finishes his ham and heads to the temple
- LS spots Kid and we rush over to disguise him best we can
  - Dirty his face, put the lavender hat and LS fluffy robe on him
- We continue trying to plan out how to steal the water
- While planning out what we will do today until the ceremony tomorrow, notice some rough looking figures
  - Pretty stacked half-orc and human sitting at the soup kitchen tables talking with each other
- LS runs into Hagatha, the begger, gaining some information where we could stay
- We plan to get our cart, find a place to sleep and hide out and attempt to sneak into the temple tomorrow prior to the ceremony
