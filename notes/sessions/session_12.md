## Story

- In three days, a ritual will occur that will enchant the water The Lady wants during a celebration
  - Celebration was for Chantia, ritual below the main square in front of Temple of Chantia
- After meeting with Sherman about The Lady's plans, the Blue Boar catches fire on the second floor
  - A set of guards came rushing with a heavy pillar as well, not sure why
- The party busts out of the Inn while a group of people rush in to try to put out the fire
- Herro turns into a black male human, with a tight small afro, named Emmit Crawstone
- The party rushes toward Rock's Roost Inn to stay now, but LS mentions they should not go directly there
  - They find a place to stop for food and hide out a little bit before going to Rock's Roost Inn
  - Chicken kebabs for lunch
- Stop to pay for the horses and wagon stay
  - Kag brings the two horses back to take them for a ride
  - LS and Kag ride the horses (Horace and Mustang)
- Head to the main square/plaza to get a layout of the area for the ritual in three days
- Look at the temple, guards milling about, priests in black robes with Chanti necklaces
- See Quasmus, lead priest, return to the temple (was part of procession Sherman was part of earlier)
  - Study Quasmus in case I need to pretend to be him
    - Has a lisp
    - Has a gold staff
    - pretty old and walks slowly
- LS gives an old hag, Hagathy, two gold as she begs and complains about her life
- The party take note of the layout of the square and then head to Rock's Roost Inn
  - Herro's disguise is dropped and returns to his normal self
  - Take the horses there since they have stables
- See two guards at the Inn, not city guards, probably hired guards
  - Look tough, having been in fights and are armed and armored well
  - Seem to prevent any lower class or beggers from entering, but we go in just fine
- LS makes a bet with Herro that Kag will not be able to lift the boulder in Rock's Roost Inn
  - 1 gp that LS doesn't think Kag can do it
  - Herro takes the bet and believes his inspiration will certainly help Kag do it
- Have the dwarven guard take the horses to the stable and the party enters
- Every table inside is filled (20 tables)
- LS asks a table of gnomes if they know about magic, as he holds the magical frying pan
- Kag prepares to attempt to lift the boulder
  - Herro gets everyone's attention and inspires Kag with [Lift the Rock Roost Rock](../docs/songs/other/lift_the_rock_roost_rock.md)
- Kag tries and just about moves it, breaking a board in the floor as he does
  - Kag gives LS 5 gp and Herro gives LS 1 gp
- Talk about rooms, which one is available for 25 gp, including the horses stay
- Herro asks about a discount for providing entertainment, but is told the is already a bard, Radovan
  - Dressed very very nice, has been here for a year performing, warming up now
- Kag pays the 25 gp for the room and stable board
- LS intimidates a table in the middle of the Inn until he gets them to leave
- Party sits down and eats the leftover food
  - Hear discussion about Radovan's performances and the Blue Boar Inn fire
  - Another building caught fire next door before "The Extinguiser" was able to put it out
- Lyre that Radovan has is very fine and has an elven inscrption:  "Music is a gift"
  - Sings "Elves of Evermarch slaying a demon of Korath"
  - Elves trapped the demon spirit in a tree
  - LS dispels his magic harp for his performance, but he does very well otherwise (a 25)
- Radovan takes a break to check his lyre
- Herro and LS take about how to address Radovan
  - "Perhaps he is involved with Danny and his horses..."
  - Kag overhears and wants to deal with him, but is called off, for now at least
  - Herro mentions the best way to take care of him is learn what he loves and take it from him
  - To take away his purpose and his "soul" basically, not necessarily bashing his face with a mace
- Two guards enter to talk with Daldi Henner, the owner
  - The guards look around a bit, but not seriously
- LS notices they are headed over to our table just as Radovan returns to the stage
  - LS and Kag are able to dismiss the guards now that Radovan prepares to sing
  - The guards leave as the crowd and LS mention how much they wish to hear Radovan sing
- Radovan finishes his songs and calls it a night
  - Kag throws a coin at him (along with other people), but misses him
- LS goes up to the room, places his alarm bells on the window and door and passes out in the middle of the bed
- Kingsly attempts to woo a woman to sleep with, finds a okay looking but probably rich
  - Does so, but learns she is married, so leaves and joins LS in the large bed
- Wake the next morning discussing what we wish to do
- Herro shows off his disguise, with advantage on any performance as Quasmus
  - Kingsly plays Quasmus's servant, Tonto, a former guild rat
- We all head over to the plaza to look into the Temple and try to find a way below the plaza
  - The area where the water will be enchanted via ritual
- Notice three elves standing in a circle in the plaza which have the same insignia as the cloak LS wears
  - Taken off the elf we killed on the road to Merish
  - They mention "the Queen" and recognize the cloak LS is wearing
- They talk with Herro about it in elven, who mentions LS won it in a game of chance
  - This Evermarch Cloak, from a group east of Merish in the mountains
  - They ask to speak to LS, and offer to buy the cloak for 30 gp as LS shouldn't have it
  - LS refuses and walks away
- They follow for a bit, as LS and the rest of us enter the Temple (they don't follow)
  - One of the three leaves and the two continue to follow (until entering the Temple)
  - LS gives Kag the cloak to put in the bag
- A sermon is about to begin shortly
  - The dwarf acolyte seems to be in charge, so Kag approaches him and asks for Sherman and work
