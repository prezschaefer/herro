## Story

- LS sits down in a pew while Kag starts helps set things up, along with Kingsly
- Later Herro and Kingsly turn invisible and attempt to find the entrance to the underground enchanting room
- Kingsly sneaks away into the right tower, invisible, heading upstairs
- Kag continues to carry kegs up from downstairs (2 floors down)
- LS finds a book about "Chantea's Guide to a Great Harvest" and goes to read it outside on the temple stairs
- Herro whispers to Kingsly, as they split, "We only have 40 minutes, I'm going to find the downstairs entrance"
  - Kingsly responds, "I'm heading upstairs, don't leave sign we know of the underground chamber."
- Herro follows Kag downstairs 2 floors, where the kegs are
  - See food storage on the first basement level, with a few hallways, to investigate later
  - Continue down to the second basement level, finding a few open rooms, one a bathroom, another distill/industry room
  - Head to a four way intersection, hear voices off to the left, go to investigate, the town square is probably to the right
    - Male and female talking about the festival and Father Quasmus
    - "Who's going to be on water duty?" responded with "I think Sherman is going to be doing that."
    - "He's only been here for two years, you think he's ready?", "I guess so, there is great trust in him."
- Kingsly tries sneaking down with a few black robes, but notices Father Quasmus exiting his chamber with someone else
  - He tries sneaking into the room, but they notice something (he's invisible), so Kingsly shoots Steven Number 1 in the face
  - He shoves Father Quasmus into the room and tortures him to get information about the water
  - He fails to convince him, threatens him with an arrow to his face, standing on him
  - He beats the Father to death for not providing him information, leaving 2 bodies in the room, looking for Kag
- Kingsly finds Kag, tells him they have to leave immediately, as Kingsly runs out of the temple, joined by Kag
  - Find LS on the steps just outside the temple
- Herro continues past the point of no return, for invisibility, but continues down the right hallway
  - He finds one door on the right side, but continues further and finds what looks the ceremony chamber
  - Takes it all in and heads back upstairs, stopping in the privy to disguish himself as one of the Elves of Evermarch
- Herro walks up and out of the temple, seeing the two other elves take notice as he motions to them
  - He tries to motion to make them leave, as he does out an opposite side, they signal back as Herro shakes his head and starts off
  - Tries to signal to LS and Kag, behind his back using Minor Illusion
- A shout that the Father has been murdered goes out
- LS and Kag head to get soup wondering what is going on, as the elves have their eyes on them
- The third elf re-enters the square, seeing Herro, disguised as one of their own leaving the other side and joins his two compatriots
- Herro leaves the square, finds a quick place to swap to Douglas Rocksettler and re-enter to get LS and Kag
  - While approaching, LS notices Douglas and starts walking toward Herro (Douglas)
- The third elf leaves once again, out the same entrance, while the other two begin following LS and Kag
- LS is holding Kag off as they follow
- Douglas is unable to tell the elves are following, but knows LS and Kag are following
- LS and Kag meet up with Douglas, as Kag pulls out the magic carpet, with his mace behind
- Herro and LS discuss what happened, Kingsly killed the Father and ran, Herro found the chamber, and two elves are following
- Kag puts the carpet away, picks up Douglas and LS and runs off, chased down by the two elves behind us
- One casts a spell on Kag as they chase him
- Douglas tries to distract them with Hypnotic Pattern, but it fails, as they try continue to pursue
  - One had tried to hit Kag, but got distracted by Herro and missed
- LS tries to distract the female elf with Disonent Whispers, but it fails to take hold
- Kag just continues to run
- The female tries to whip Kag, hitting him, but isn't able to restrain him, the other elf throws another star/dart but misses and stops
  - He shouts in elvish he can track Kag if they lose him
- Douglas tells LS and Kag about the tracking, and mocks the female with the whip
- LS causes the remaining elf, female, to think her clothes are on fire
- Kag continues to run as the female elf stops, thinking she is on fire
- Kag rushes to a guard and tells him the elves, down the street, are trying to murder people
- Douglas mentions he saw one of them exit the temple, then hearing shouting of the Father being murdered
  - The elves then chased us for seeing one exit, trying to kill us
- The group returns to the Rock Roost Inn, as Douglas tells them they are pretty confident they can track us
- Kag goes to check the horses as Douglas and LS find Kingsly and hear the bard playing tonite
