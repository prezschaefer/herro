## Story

- Took (short and fat) and Damn (tall and lanky), work for the "The Lady", just freed us
    - agreed to a pact, blood pact
- Guards were put to sleep shortly before, but may be waking/woken up
- The Lady needs us in Merish, meet at the Blue Boar at noon in one week
- Need to move 4 floors up to get out
- Lyrical Slave rips off a rap after being freed
- Tony rushes to the door to find a way out
- Kag kicks in a door, by Tony's orders, finding another set of cells
- Find guards still knocked out, take their weapons and their keys
    - LS throws some keys into other cell blocks, although out of reach of prisoners
- Continue on through the hallways
    - Find 3 guards over a sleeping one, we fire down the hallway, Tony launches grease
- Kag charges in, launches Tony bowling style, and rams into them
- I attempt to trick them into running, but they call for help
- Tony slides in and jumps back onto Kag
- LS bounces in and casts shatter
    - Tony is knocked out; Escabar, the sleeping guard is hurt bad
    - LS awakes Tony with Healing Word
- The guards attempt to atack Kag, but the grease prevents them from hitting them
- Kag slams Tony into a guard, knocking Tony and the guard out
- I heal Tony who then gets up and runs ahead
- LS rushes up to Escabar, and suggests he get LS out of here, who responds positively to this
- The last guard runs away, takes a swipe at Tony, seeing this I yell at the guard to forget the gnome and to run, so he misses
- We rush through the next large room, like an armory, where 5 men are just waking up
- They start following us, lead by Escabar, and myself as a guard
- We meet a group of guards on the stairwell up, after a clog, we persuade the guards to move past, down the stairs
- We continue up and hear an attack on the throne room is happening at the moment as well
- We ask Escabar to take us to the Kitchen, on the second floor, for some food and then escape. foregoing the weapon stores
- Kag breaks down a door leading to the main floor, where two guards are posted
- LS ask Escabar to allow me to talk, which I am able to deceive them that we are trying to hurry these civilians to safety
- We make our way to the kitchens, we go unminded initially, until Kag attempts to get food.
    - A female elf attempts to stop him and remove us, until Kag punches him
    - The civilians following us realize we are the bad guys
    - 15 chefs pull knives and charge us; Kag fails to intimidate them, and I fail to deceive them to leave
- I rush to hold this female elf hostage and yell to keep the chefs back, dropping my guard disguise
- One group stops, the other guy continues to move forward and stab the shit out of me, as I am barely standing
- Tony distracts them with his invention that invigerates people, saying it will heal her, although it won't as he rushes to the window
- Kag follows picking him up as he dashses to the window
- LS follows the others, but as he does mocks one chefs cooking, and he instantly kills himself in shame, he then gives me combatic inspiration
- I evade the nearby chefs, heal myself, and attempt to run towards the windows
- Two chefs chase me down, the rest attempt to help their female elven leader, I am able to dodge the attack from the inspiration
- Tony gives Kag additional speed and causes his tool to explode, killing all the chefs
- Kag, now expediated, rushes to the window to escape
- Everyone follows out, as I grab what food I can and follow as well
