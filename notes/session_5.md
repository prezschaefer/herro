# Session 5


## Story

- We are traveling towards our destination
  - Meet some travelers on the way, advertise Bruce's Wagon Imporium
  - Large rocks all around the area, from catapults in battle a few years ago
  - looking for a place to sleep, go near a group of them just off the road
- Kag is a bit rough on Toni, for hurts the horses
- We setup camp and attempt to get a long rest
- A flying carpet moves overhead during first watch, but nothing more
- Kag talks an owl into investigating a campfire nearby, finding 6 people with "metal at their hips"
- We collect ourselves in the morning and continue on
- An hour into travel we near the other campfire site
  - Find nothing of interest
- Run into a mother, father, and son
  - I perform some tricks for the boy and impress him
- LS uses The Speaker to shout at someone ahead who appears to be moving off the road to hide in the grass
  - LS tosses a rock at this person, hitting them in the forehead
- Toni demands the elf's cloak for a gold
- The elf mentions he was hiding so he wouldn't be robbed
  - Turns out that's kind of what we are doing now
- LS tells Kag to not get any blood on the cloak
- The elf muttors "This will slow me down."
- He disappears as Kag chases after him swinging wildly
- I drop a cube of glowing green light on top of Kag and this elf
- Kag takes the brunt of the damage, being the only one up close
- Toni drops grease on Kag and the elf, which seems to only affect Kag
- LS rushes up, grabbing the sword on my hip, charges toward the elf
- Toni is throwing scissors, LS is trying to help attack, Kag is bashing away, and Herro is trying to keep his distance
  - LS and Kag struggle on the grease, but Herro and the elf don't seem affected
- The elf tosses the cloak off, misty steps away and attempts to run away
- Kag catches up and smashes the elf further
- LS grabs the cloak and returns to the cart, where Toni is upset that LS ended up with the cloak
- I rush up to try to stop Kag from finishing the elf, if the elf offeres information
  - Kag basically talks Herro into just finishing the elf off
  - Kag and Herro strip everything off the elf
  - Herro casts invisibility on the body and they return to the cart
- With another group approaching from behind, the party sets out on the road again, with their spoils
