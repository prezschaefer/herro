## Personal Storyline

- Terranum's letters, two unopened
- from Queen Helimossi
- trapped letters burn up if opened without untriggering
- Farseer Emissary's are spies, hence the self destructing letters
- two 'locked' letters contain similar information, as one was to be passed one
- the two recipients are directed to two agents, explaining the self destruct


### Letters

>Terranem, the time has come where we can not contain the entity any longer
on our own. Please seek out our allies in Paocinon and give them these letters.
Please go with haste, your queen, Helmossi


>Farseer Emmissary Elama,
The feir tree is losing its power, we need assistance immediately. You will
find another letter that you should deliver to our Farseer Emissary in
Friscocan City.
your queen, Helmossi


>Farseer Emissary Eiramil,
