## Story

- Guards have been collected information on the events at the Arcane square
- Toni and I go out for breakfast and information in the morning
    - Leave Keg and Lyrical Slave behind
- Find out the guards are going to be going house to house today looking for criminals
    - Guard going around announcing the events of yesterday every hour
- We need to find a way out of the city before the guards find us
    - Taxi flying carpets will not leave the city
- We make up a plan of how to exit the city
    - Kag wishes to be smuggled out inside a large keg
    - Toni wants to rent horses and a wagon to leave
    - We combine our plans
- Toni finds 192 gp in his stash, Keg 1 gp in a coin purse hidden in his beard, and I supply the last 4 gp for yesterday
    - LS attempts to disguise Keg, with anything he can find, it looks "meh", maybe...
- Toni lights up his home as we exit
- I disguise myself as an older baldding male human with a scar on his face
- We make our way to the horse wagon shop, Bruce Springtime
    - Toni rubs the owener the wrong way
    - I am able to smooth things over and we come to an agreement to get the horses and wagon we need for 190 gp
    - I tell him I will advertise for his shop to all I meet
    - Franklin Berrybottom
- As a group of guards enter the square, Toni gets ansy and insults Bruce and then storms off
- I appologize and walk after Toni, who whispers he has a plan
    - He "trips", well tries to, and falls down shouting "You brute!"
    - I attempt to start a play to entertain and distract the audience around us
    - Toni hurls a stone at me, poisoning me, but I attempt to continue the play
    - Toni, portrayed as Douglas Rocksettler, in our play of "The Daylight Sands"
    - The guards approach and I tell we are only performing
    - They warn us to have a permit, but also recognize Toni
- The guards attack Toni twice, but deal little to no damage
- Kag rushes in on the horse and wagon, with LS
    - He leaps off, and grabs me, to take me back, I say, "Ah, here is our stagehand, Zepherous"
    - Kag grabs Toni as well and is struck by one of the guards as he rushes back onto the wagon
- LS tries to charm two of the guards, charming one of them
- Toni summons a fire turret at the back of the wagon, burning a series of people nearby
- I shout, using Minor Illusion, "What play would be complete without a dramatic rescue scene?! The Daylight Sands, coming to you soon!!"
