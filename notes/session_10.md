## Story

- Granny VanWinkle tells Omar (LS) to watch Kag Featherbottom as she goes for a walk
  - Removes disguise and returns to Herro
  - Herro goes to pay 20 gp to the Smithenson's family keeping horses and wagon
- Herro returns, "surprised" to find Kag passed out
- Herro helps LS take Kag up to his room and they spend the day talking and watching
- Wake up the next morning, the 6th day of the planned 7 days to meet The Lady
- LS is talking to a very old male elf, about rumors, etc. in town
  - Hear of pick pocketing in the northern distract
  - Two dead bodies a few blocks down, the couple Kag punched in the face
    - Thought to be a guild killing
- During breakfast, we find Kingsly sad and upset about drinking and failing The Lady
- The Lady is a goddess known as some kind of demon
  - She doesn't just kill or murder necessarily, more about spying
- Kingsly asks for The Lady to forgive him, very loudly, causing everyone to take notice
  - Kingsly smashes his plate upset, Sammule is upset questioning "This Lady"
- Herro joins for breakfast, after Sammule asks if he will break a plate for "The Lady" too
  - Herro tells him a super sad tale about "his lady" leaving him, even taking his dog, Rex
  - Herro raises a drink, "This is for Rex." choking back tears
- Everyone goes hat shopping to lighten the mode
  - Herro disguises himself as a tall young red haired female human, Marci Flowertop
  - LS ends up not joining, distracted by something
  - Kingsly is not interested either, so goes up to his room
- Kag pays 20 gp to the Smithenson's family for the day
- Kag and Herro arrive at market
- Herro, as Marci, trades his fancy longsword for a super nice dagger and some arrows
  - Dagger cannot be disarmed and does 1d6 damage
  - 10 Armor piecing arrows, do a +1 damage
- Hat shop is closed, so go to get Kag some green apples
- Guards stop us and question us, as a couple
  - Mention that gnomes and goblins are super dangerous, not the orc they are looking for
- Go to the Tremendous Tops clothing store for hats
  - Kag custom orders a "cowboy" hat, to be delivered for 10 gp
  - Herro buys a lavender Panama style hat, for LS, for 3 gp
- A commotion is caused outside
  - Missy mentions she thinks it is more pick pockets
  - Marci asks if Missy heard about the commotion the other day in the market
  - Marci attempts to tie it to Danny, owner of local horse and wagons
  - Also mentions Danny is known for fornicating with his horses too
- Kag and Marci (Herro) go outside to investigate, hearing a half-orc boy stole a purse
- Kag immediately runs after the direction the boy and guards went
- Marci explains he is after justice and rushes after to keep Kag safe from himself
- Marci sees Lowki just leaning over a stoop while running
  - "Hey you! I know you."
- Lowki is drunk and pissed Marci calls out his son as a theif
  - Marci charms Lowki, who starts spilling the beans and mentions "The Operations"
  - Lowki mentions he is in charge of the pick pocketing
  - Marci attempts to show off her skills, but he isn't impressed
  - Marci then attempts to show Lowki, by stealing from a man in a family group nearby
  - Marci fails terribly, very terribly
  - The little guards yells out and starts calling out for the guards to help
  - Everyone is focused on Marci now, with a coin purse on the ground and 10 gp (Herro's)
- Marci accuses Lowki of putting her up to stealing
- Lowki denies it (no longer charmed), as the husband has his wife and daughter Lisa rush off for guards
- Marci charms the husband, tells him Lowki has her son and made him disappear, as she cries
- Marci charges Lowki, crying, shouting "You made my son disappear, you monster!"
  - She goes invisible right in front of Lowki and sneaks by him
- Lowki rushes off
- Marci sneaks behind him for a bit, then returns to Herro, no longer invisible, returns to the Blue Boar Inn
