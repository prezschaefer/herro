# Words of Warning

```
The castle has been attacked,
criminals are now on the loose.
There is nothing we all can do,
besides sit and drop a deuce.
The times seem to be getting darker,
as if we are now under a curse.
You best stay at home indoors,
watching your children and your purse.
But this I will offer you,
a song or warning and of praise.
Remember your loved ones around you,
hold them close in these dark days.
```
