# Before Awaking

```
No one truly knows the happenings before awaking,
the things that happen before people start baking.
Do the birds chirp, do the stars continue to shine,
There is no knowing without being given a sign.
We wake to greet the day with utter joy,
like a mom seeing the face of a new born boy.
Every new day a gift from the gods most certain,
take advantage before they draw your curtain.
We must wake early to see the sun rise,
every single day we are given is a prize.
```
