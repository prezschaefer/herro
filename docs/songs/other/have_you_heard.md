# Have you Heard

```
Have you heard? Have you heard?!
We have just gotten the word.
The Daylight Sands are coming here,
tickets will sell out immediately I fear.
Even Douglas Rocksettler is in it,
with Franklin Berrybottom's famous wit.
A tale of betrayal and heart break,
a story that simply will make your heart ache.
This will be the story of our time,
missing out on it will be a crime.
Do everything you can to get yourself a seat,
it is going to be so so sweet!
