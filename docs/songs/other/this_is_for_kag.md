This One is for Kag

```
This Kag is one hell of an orc you know,
get on his bad side, he'll reap what you sow.
Kag is know for many different things,
heralded for everything that he brings.
I'll make it very simple and spell it out,
he is great, of that there is no doubt.

K is for killing, which he does without fail.
A is for attacking, with just a blink he will impale.
G is for gallons, tons of gallons of gore...and ale.
