# Day Seven Meeting

```
Kag and Herro return from their hat shopping trip,
Herro tries to remember Marci by writing her a quip.
The next morning we await our meeting on the seventh day,
perhaps we can find out what it is we must now pay.
LS suggests Sammule go out on a trip to the nearby town,
while Herro as Sammule tells everyone he is closing down.
Herro has everyone else leave the Inn until later on,
as the party waits for the meeting now with everyone gone.
A few times we are disturbed by knocking while we wait,
but we get them all to go away, which is certainly great.
Finally, an acolyte, Sherman, arrives to tell us what to do,
as part of our service to The Lady debut.
We are to steal some important water from a vase,
after it is enchanted inside a very holy place.
