# Tremendous Tops with Marci

```
As Granny VanWinkle leaves, Herro returns to the Inn,
seeing the results of a drinking contest Kag did not win.
Everyone takes the rest of the day to take a good rest,
it has been a while since everyone felt safe and at their best.
Kingsly is upset he broke an oath and had a drink the other day,
it seems it was certainly something against his way.
Marci and Kag go out shopping to find him a nice new hat,
after picking one up we hear about the same dirty street rat.
Kag takes off after the same small kid in hot pursuit,
Marci tries to keep up running into the father on the route.
Lowki mentions a bit about his group's operations in town,
Marci tries to join in order to bring it all down.
However, she gets caught trying to steal off some man,
trying to prove herself to Lowki the best she can.
To save herself, she rushes at Lowki for taking her son,
blaming him for everything that she has now done.
"My son disappeared because of this man!" she starts to yell,
Marci charges toward him, turns invisible, and disappears as well.
Herro makes his way back to the Inn to the rest of the group,
having wasted a portion of the day and resting simply to recoup.
