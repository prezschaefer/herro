# Making it to Merish

```
Toni and I use the carpet to fly up above,
we soar through the air just like a dove.
We set up a camp in a small tree grove,
a few men watch me act a tale I just wove.
We continue on to Merish after sun rise,
arriving to find the city a small on size.
Kag chugs Toni's jug full of water for now,
changed to vinegar and mayonnaise, just wow!
After Kag pukes it up we look for the market,
arriving in the wagon looking for a place to park it.
As we promote Bruce's we hear a faint shout,
but we all know Danny's horses are shit no doubt.
Kag shopping for produce sees a robbing street rat,
Kag chases him down and is ready to pound him flat.
