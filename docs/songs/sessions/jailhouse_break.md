# Jailhouse Break

```
I was sitting in the dark in my cell,
just another day in this god forsaken hell.
Down the row, I glimpse a small light,
Even such a small amount is a welcome sight.
Just then the cell block door is thrown in,
the door crumpled like a piece of tin.
Two creatures enter offering escape for a price,
they ask me to accept this offer that does entice.
There are now four of us trying to run,
I had no idea what I may have just done.
