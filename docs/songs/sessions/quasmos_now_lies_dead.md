# Quasmos Now Lies Dead

```
We enter the temple to begin our search,
to find a way beneath the square in the church.
We go invisible so we can then sneak around,
unfortunately we can still make a sound.
While Kag works and LS watches from a pew,
Kingsly is about to throw our plan askew.
Herro finds a way down searching for this room,
as Kingsly brings about Quasmos' own doom.
As everyone now tries to make a hasty escape,
we are chased down by the elves after LS cape.
Able to flee from the elves that are in pursuit,
we make our way past a guard on our route.
We are able to tie these elves to murder of the priest,
a disguise I used exiting the temple after the deceased.
Finally returning back to the Inn, Kag gives another try,
he fails to lift the rock, but is close you can't deny.
