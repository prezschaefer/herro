# Robbing the Unknown Traveler

```
On the road to Merish we stop and set up a camp,
L.S. lights the area with 4 globes like a lamp.
Kag is a bit rough on Toni for harming the horses,
while we were dealing with the enemy forces.
Kag is able to talk an owl to check on a nearby light,
finding 6 bipedals with metal probably ready to fight.
I wake up the next morning after a poor sleep to find,
I had slept on a large rock putting my back in a bind.
We get right back onto the road to continue ahead,
searching the next camp finding nothing but their bed.
"Don't forget to visit Bruce's Wagon Imporium.", I say,
as we pass a group of travelers heading the other way.
L.S. spots someone on the road ahead coming towards us,
he disappears off the road, something we must discuss.
Toni attempts to buy this elf's flowing cloak,
L.S. asks Kag to simply take it from this bloke.
A fight with him quickly breaks out after this,
he is unwilling to give, as it is something he will miss.
He turns invisible when Kag approaches him,
Kag chases after this invisible form on a whim.
I flash a green sphere lighting up the two,
negating his invisibility and showing him true.
After a bloody fight the elf attempts to run,
tossing his cloak behind before his life is done.
Kag and I catch up to him, begging for himself,
Kag stands over him as I take pity on this elf.
However, Kag makes a very compelling assertion,
and smashes the elf with little show of exertion.
We quickly loot the remains of the crushed elf,
for now keeping the loot we found to ourself.
