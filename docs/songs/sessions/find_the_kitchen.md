# Find the Kitchen

```
As we made our way up to the main floor,
we snuck past guards more and more.
Kag battles guards attempting to fight,
swinging his weapon, Toni, left and right.
L-Slave charms Escabar to escort us out,
I acting as a guard causing little doubt.
We made our way to the kitchen upstairs,
upon entering we found a lot of stares.
I took the head chef hostage and threatened to kill,
half the chefs charged to dice me like dill.
Just when things seemed to be the darkest,
we jumped out a window not landing the hardest.
