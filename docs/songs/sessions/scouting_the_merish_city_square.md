# Scouting the Merish City Square

```
We have three days to prepare our plan,
as the Blue Boar catches fire we ran.
We stop at the city square to take a peek,
as under here, the ritual we will seek.
Shortly after, we head to the Rock's Roost Inn,
a boulder Kag wishes to lift lies within.
That is when we first see Radovan, a bard,
using a Lyre that I desire pretty hard.
Radovan sings about a group of elves from Evermarch,
seeling a great evil in a tree such as a larch.
Guards seem to be searching for us,
but their presence actually causes a fuss.
In the morning we make our way back to the square,
as we knew the ritual would be underground somewhere.
LS Evermarch cloak attracks an unset group of elves,
it seems we now have to look out for ourselves.
We arrive at the temple to find a way to explore,
to find a way below so we can complete our chore.
