# Ticket out of Paocinon

```
We woke after a comfortable meaningful nights rest,
out in search of breakfast to start the day at our best.
We heard tale of a group of criminals who broke out of jail,
the guards searching homes for them, dedicated to prevail.
We found horse and cart to make our way out of the city,
but as guards approached, it seemed things wouldn't go pretty.
In hopes of a distraction, I determined we must put on an act,
Franklin Berrybottom put on a performance; that is a fact.
But they were able to recognize Toni and attacked us,
it almost caused me to drop character and cuss.
That's when Kag rushed in on the wagon and grabbed us both,
so we could escape town and go to fulfill our oath.
As we rushedly left the area I stood and took a bow,
"The Daylight Sands coming soon!", I shouted as we said Ciao.
