# Case of the Window Intruders

```
It all happened last night,
a terrible time for a fight.
The Great Danton is called in,
to solve a mystery yet again.
As everyone holds their breath,
he pins them to the priest's death.
After finally getting a nights rest,
the group plans to continue their quest.
Kingsly gets himself into some trouble,
everyone has to hurry out on the double.
The party is able to latter regroup,
working to find a place to recoup.
We decide to find somewhere to sleep,
hidden and somewhere that is cheap.
