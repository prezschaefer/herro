# Completing Our Escape

```
We land outside the window at ground level,
now to find how to keep this pact with the devil.
Moving through the streets we stop to shop,
L-Slave earns money with a beat he did drop.
Toni threatens a vendor with magical destruction,
the crowd is upset by this kind of obstruction.
We try to escape before guards arrive,
I impresonate one in hopes we will survive.
Somehow we escape the mob in the square,
from here on we had best take care.
We make our way out to Toni's old home,
all of this crazy will make such a great poem.
