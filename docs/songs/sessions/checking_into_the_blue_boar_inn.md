# Checking into the Blue Boar Inn

```
Word has spread in Merish that some have escaped from jail,
our attempts at keeping a low profile may soon fail.
While we approach the Blue Boar Inn to book ourselves a room,
we run into Trevor with which a friendship starts to bloom.
Trevor mentions a place we could keep our wagon and horse,
word of Danny's evil has raced around town, us as the source.
Kag and I head inside to setup our stay at the Inn,
finding it crowded with elderly I manage to keep my grin.
Kag loudly mentions a gnome had attacked the King,
the barmaid doesn't buy it even with everyting I bring.
LS bursts into wondering what the hell we are doing,
waiting for us at the wagon, the anger just brewing.
Kag rushes out to the wagon to chase someone off,
a "Looky Lou" runs away as all Kag does is simply scoff.
LS goes up to a room to rest while I bring Kag an ale,
waiting at the wagon out front as Trevor gives us a hail.
He takes us to a house to keep the wagon and horses secure,
a place easy for us to access later he does assure.
We walk back to the Inn to lay low and get a good rest,
we have to stay hidden and be ready to be at our best.
