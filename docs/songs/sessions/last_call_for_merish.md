# Last Call for Merish

```
"Bruce's Wagon Imporium is the best!", I shout,
as we are leaving our most recent bout.
We've got to find a way out of this town,
before anything more serious goes down.
L.S. shouts "Advertisements for sale!",
Jose walks up, interested in this hail.
However, a set of guards interrupts L.S. pitch,
all he can think is, "Son of a bitch!"
As usual, things go south very fast,
it doesn't help things given our past.
Mr. Berrybottom puts on quite an act,
another part of my play, soon to be backed.
Unego is interested in none of this,
"Answer my questions!", he says with a hiss.
Toni is rushing away with our cart,
busting the axel as it falls apart.
Kag slices up the guards trying to stop us,
having him out in the front is a plus.
Kag finishes the two guards and loots,
taking everything they have but their boots.
Everyone returns to the cart and climbs on,
as our curtain in Paocinon is finally drawn.
