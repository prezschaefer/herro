# Acquiring a Bomb

```
The day has almost arrived,
not sure how we have survived.
We stop to gear ourselves up,
preparing to steal water in a cup.
Kingsly decides we need a bomb,
so volatile we must remain calm.
Just then he is spotted in the street,
getting us out of this would be a feat.
Kag meets up with a group with a plan,
to steal 7000gp from the temple clan.
We meet at Hagatha's to rest and hide,
but that's when emotions collide.
The hobos are murdered in their bed,
a fire is set to destroy the dead.
