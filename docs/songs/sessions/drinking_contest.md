# Drinking Contest

```
We wake the next day to find an invisible wall,
we seem to be stuck upstairs in the hall.
Kag rushes and leaps out the window in LS's room,
LS and Herro leap out as well perhaps to their doom.
A trio of guards soon approach the group,
Herro turns into an old lady in an attempt to dupe.
Granny VanWinkle and Omar make a goblin distraction,
this causes the guards to rush off into action.
We then enter the Blue Boar Inn for breakfast,
but the invisible wall is being a bit of a pest.
A platinum blonde human then enters the Inn,
Kingsly Clearwatter introduces himself with a grin.
He challenges Kag the Crusher to a drinking contest,
LS starts taking bets on the this from the rest.
Kag does his best but seems Kingsly is doing well,
Kingsly tries to leave early as LS stops him with a spell.
However in the end it is Kingsly who ends up winning,
Kag passes out as the room starts spinning.
