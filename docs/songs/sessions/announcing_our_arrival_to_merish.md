# Announcing our Arrival to Merish

```
Kag has caught his street rat thief holding onto him,
holding him up in the air simply by a limb.
And just when a fight is about to break out,
LS "announces" Bruce's is the best like a shout.
The guards are alerted and now searching for the source,
they make their way towards the wagon and horse.
LS calls for help from The Lady in this danger,
unfortunately to all of us she is just a stranger.
I use an illusion to distract the guards toward the crowd,
shouting, "Danny's horses are shit!" very very loud.
LS joins with, "Danny fucks his horses!" causing confusion,
giving us a chance to escape, the guards focused on the illusion.
Toni leaps off the wagon, determined to be on his own,
we have to continue on as our cover is now blow.
LS notices a couple discussing among them The Lady,
we chase them down into an alley, all of it a bit shady.
As we question them about The Lady, Kag persuades the two,
but his punches kill them on the spot, who knew?!
We leave the alley and make our way to the Blue Boar Inn,
not knowing young Peeping Tommy could've seen our sin.
