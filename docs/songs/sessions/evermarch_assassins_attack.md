# Evermarch Assassins Attack

```
Now unsure of our future we head off to bed,
late at night LS sees out the window a head.
One of the Evermarch elves tries to break in,
trying to charm him before troublesome things begin.
As a last ditch attempt I shout out to talk,
my words are ignored as the assassins balk.
Combat ensues packed inside this little room,
this place looks like it might be our tomb.
Things are dire as LS falls on the magic rug,
knocked out and wrapped up in it nice and snug.
A desperate attempt to revive LS is necessary,
on death's door we are able to, but just barely.
Kag and Kingsly beat down two of the elves inside,
as a third then makes a run for it outside.
Guards are now alongside us after the fight,
it is turning out to be quite a night.
